Every year, millions of tons of plastic waste end up in the ocean, harming marine life and disrupting ecosystems. According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (2021), by 2050, there could be more plastic than fish in the ocean if no drastic action is taken. WEWO is taking a stand against plastic waste by integrating a reverse vending machine system that rewards users for recycling plastic bottles.",
